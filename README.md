# ghpages-vite-react-tailwind-template

Template with the basic Vite/React project, TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier, and a
GitHub action to build and deploy the site to GHPages.

Make sure to change the base path in `vite.config.js` to the name of your repo,
since GHPages are hosted at `<user>.github.io/<repo>`. For example, this template
is available at <https://tecnd.github.io/ghpages-vite-react-tailwind-template/>.
